Constructor:

Q1. Need to initalize the member variable when object is construct.
We need constructor for this.
Constructor is call when object is created.
So constructor will initialize the member variables
Constructor name is same as class name
Constructor never return anything
It is called only once
One class can have multiple constructors, So this thing is called 
constructor overloading
Every class by default have default constructor.
So if you create any other constructor the default one is killed.

When we need multiple constructor calls in a single call
Ans: We need constructor chaining for this
this keyword also use for constructor chaining
