Main Method:

- main is a entry point of every java program
- Without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code but can't execute the code or
	interpret the code

4 types of scope in java
public: global, which is accessible for all, from any where

private: accesssible within class only

protected: can be accessed inside the package/folder/directory, can also be accessed outside the package 
	by using inheritance

default: It is not a reserved keyword, if you will not specify any scopee then it is default. The scope can be 
	accessed by any class but within same package.

Why main is static?

- static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded.

Why main is void?

- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

Main Arguments - String args[]

- main has command line arguments
for e.g: copy file1.txt file2.txt
- copy is a command and file1.txt & file2.txt are arguments

What is command line Arguments?

- we can make our own commands
for e.g: Wish Happy Birthday 11:59PM 3964986586

- Wish is a command and Happy Birthday 11:59PM 3964986586 are the arguments
- We can pass any number of arguments that's why it is array type
- All arguments are pass to main in form of array of string

What is String?

- String is a collection of class
- String internally is a char[]
- String is a predefined class in java as it is in capital letter

What is System.out.println()?

- println(): print in new line which comes from out object
- out: out is a preddefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System is a predefined class used for input, output, error
e.g: System.in, System.out, and System.err

println vs print

- println: print in new line
- print: here cursor remains at the end of the text

Can we overload main()?

- yes we can overload the main()
- When we execite the class , JVM starts execution with public static void main(String args[])
