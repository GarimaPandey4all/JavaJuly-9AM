2 types of programming:

1. Procedural Programming: Functions - Divide a problem into functions
	e.g. C programming Language
2. OOPS (Object Oriented Programming Language): Wrap all the variables and functions into a single unit

Let's take an example:

class A {
int a, b;
void add(){
a + b;
}
void sub(){
a - b;
}
void div(){
a / b;
}
void mul(){
a * b;
}
}
class B {
void sin(){
double a;
}
}


Create a first program in java:

- Every java program start with class
- Class name should start with capital letter
- Class name should be same as file name
- Class name starts with either alphabet or specialsymbol(_, $)

Compile Code in Java 
- javac filename.java

Execute/Run the java code
- java classname/byte code
