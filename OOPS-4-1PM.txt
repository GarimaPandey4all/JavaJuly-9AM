Class Relationship:

- Communicate b/w two classes

1. IS - A Inheritance

BMW is a Car
Lion is a animal
FB is a app
SavingAccount is a Account
Homeloan is a loan
PartTimeEmployee is a Employee

2. HAS - A Inheritance

BMW has a driver
Customer has a order
Customer has a Account

1. In Development

One class one file
If your class is public so class name must be same as file name
so in one file we can have n non public classes.
If one file (X.java) has 3 classes e.g
class X{} class Y{} class Z{}
After compile it will create 3 byte codes
X.class Y.class Z.class


Java provide single inheritance in case of classes.
Java also provide multiple inheritance in case of interfaces.

Overriding:

When parent feature is outdated so we override the parent feature in a child class.
Override hide the parent feature.

1. Must be inheritance
2. Method Signature must be same
void roi(), same child has same method as void roi()
