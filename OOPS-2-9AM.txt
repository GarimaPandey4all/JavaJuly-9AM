Two types of programming:

1. Procedural Programming : Function : C lang
2. Object Oriented Programming Language: C++, Java, C# etc

Calculator in C
class A
{
int a, b;
add()
{}
sub()
{}
div()
{}
mul()
{}
}
class B
{
sin()
{
double a;
}
}

Is java has global variable?
No, Because in java every program start with class, and class doesn't have 
global variable.

C- We think only for functions
We never think of data, so either data/variable are define local or global.
And Global can be conflict with others.

C++: OOPs - provide a feature of data binding using classes.
So your class have your variable and your methods that never conflict 
with other developers.

Now in OOPs we can use same variable names, same method name in different classes.

What is OOPs?

Divide a Big problem into classes.
OOPs Features:

1. Class and Object

- Class is collection of similar objects. - Logical Entity
- Object - real world entity - Physical Entity

Class : Human

Object: Ram, Rahul, Garima etc
