What is String?

- String internally char[]
e.g: String name = "Ram";
char name[] = {'R', 'a', 'm'};

- String is a predefine class in java, So it has lot of predefine functions inside the class-
e.g: uppercase, lowercase, length, indexof, split, equals etc
- It is also treat like a Data Type
- String is a final class, so you can't inherit
- String objects are created in 2 ways
a) String Literal Style
e.g: String name = "Ram";

b) String Object Style
e.g: String name = new String("Ram");

- String use String Pool

- String objects are immutable
	string doesn't change existing or original objects, it can create new memory or object all the time.

But StringBuffer is mutable that means it doesn't create new objects or memory
