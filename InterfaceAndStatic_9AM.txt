Interface:

Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface 
are by default abstract(only method signature, no body)

- It is used to acheive total abstraction
- Since java does not support multiple inheritance in case of class, but by using interface it 
can acheive multiple inheritance.
- Interfaces are used to implement abstraction. 

Static use in java
